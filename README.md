# stock-predict-with-news-sentiment-analysis
This is my final project at university. 
I used the statistic model of GARCH and EGARCH to predict the stock price of Vingroup (VIC). 
Besides, I experimented with applying OpenAI API and gpt-3.5-turbo model for 2 linguistic language tasks, including Entity relationship extraction and News sentiment analysis.
